### Features üì∏

* **Multi-Page Structure**: The site is composed of two linked pages: a Home page and a Contact page.
* **Semantic HTML**: Uses modern HTML5 tags such as `<header>`, `<main>`, `<nav>`, `<aside>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>` for a logical and accessible structure.
* **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to different screen sizes using CSS media queries, providing a consistent experience on desktops and mobile devices.
* **Organized CSS**: All styling is consolidated into a single, clean stylesheet (`style.css`), improving code maintenance.
* **Contact Form**: Includes a basic, non-functional contact form with input fields and a submit button.
