# To-Do List App
This project is a simple, modern To-Do List web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add tasks, mark them as complete, and delete them. The app uses local storage to save tasks, so your list will persist even if you close and reopen your browser.

### Features üìã
Add Tasks: Easily add new tasks by typing into the input field and pressing the "Add" button or the Enter key.

Mark as Complete: Click on a task to mark it as complete. A line will appear through the text, and a checkmark will be added.

Delete Tasks: Remove a task from the list by clicking the trash icon next to it.

Data Persistence: Your tasks are automatically saved in the browser's localStorage, so your list remains intact on page refresh or browser close.

Responsive Design: The layout adjusts to fit different screen sizes for use on mobile and desktop devices.
